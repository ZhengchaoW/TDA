# DSC 214: Topological Data Analysis

## Basic Information
**Instructor:** [Dr. Zhengchao Wan](zhengchaow.github.io) (zcwan@ucsd.edu)

**Lectures:** Tuesdays/Thursdays, 9:30am - 10:50am, Center Hall 217A

**Office Hours:** Tuesdays 10:50am - 11:50am or by appoinment (zcwan@ucsd.edu)


## Course Description
Topological methods provide powerful tools for characterizing structures/features behind data and analyzing diverse complex data (images, graphs, point sets, etc). This course introduces basic concepts and topological structures, as well as recent topological tools, algorithms, as well as examples to applications. Some topics include: basics in topology, simplicial complexes to model data, persistent homology, discrete Morse theory, topology inference, the Mapper methodology, hierarchical clustering, and integration of topological methods with machine learning. A tentative list of topics is listed below.

This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students.

**Prerequisite:** Linear algebra, algorithms (DSC40B or equivalent)

## Topics
The course may cover (but is not limited to) the following topics:
- Basic concepts (graphs, connected components, topological space, manifold, point cloud samples)
- Combinatorial structures on point cloud data (simplicial complexes)
- New techniques in dimension reduction (circular coordinates, etc.)
- Clustering (topology-based data partition, classification)
- Homology and persistent homology
- Topological signatures for classification
Structural inference and reconstruction from data
- Topological algorithms for massive data
- Multivariate and high-dimensional data analysis
- Topological data analysis for visualization (vector fields, topological structures)
- Practical applications of TDA

## Grading policy
There is a final project/survey: 100%
- The final grade is based on four parts
  - proposal
  - project
  - report
  - short presentation
- Requirement: Each student is required to meet briefly with me around 3-4th week, so that we can discuss to find a good potential topic for your final project. After a topic is chosen, you are required to submit a short proposal about what you intend to work on. Later, after you finish your project, you will submit a final report (4+ pages, single spacing), which should clearly describe the motivation of your project, what you have done, and your findings. A 5-min presentation is also needed. A survey needs to be 10+ pages.

Timeline
- Week 2-5: Students meet with me to discuss project topic .
- Week 6: Selection of final project topic done. Project proposal due by end of May 8th, 2022 (Sunday) (extended from previous May 6th deadline). 
- Week 10: Finish up your final project
- Final week: Final project report as well as your recorded presentation are due (there is no late submission accepted as I need to assign final grades). Please submit the video to the google drive I shared with you (information will be available in canvas then), and send the report to my email
