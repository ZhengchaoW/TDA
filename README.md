# DSC 214: Topological Data Analysis

## Basic Information
**Instructor:** [Zhengchao Wan](zhengchaow.github.io) (zcwan@ucsd.edu)

**Lectures:** Tuesdays/Thursdays, 9:30am - 10:50am, Center Hall 217A

**Office Hours:** Thursdays 10:50am - 11:50am or by appointment (zcwan@ucsd.edu)


## Course Description
Topological methods provide powerful tools for characterizing structures/features behind data and analyzing diverse complex data (images, graphs, point sets, etc). This course introduces basic concepts and topological structures, as well as recent topological tools, algorithms, as well as examples to applications. Some topics include: basics in topology, simplicial complexes to model data, persistent homology, discrete Morse theory, topology inference, the Mapper methodology, hierarchical clustering, and integration of topological methods with machine learning. A tentative list of topics is listed [here](schedule.pdf)

This course is for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students.

**Prerequisite:** Linear algebra, algorithms



## Grading policy
There is a final project/survey: 100%
- The final grade is based on four parts
  - proposal
  - project
  - report
  - short presentation
- Requirement: 
  - Each student is required to meet briefly with me around 3-4th week, so that we can discuss to find a good potential topic for your final project. 
  - After a topic is chosen, you are required to submit a short proposal (1-2 pages) about what you intend to work on. 
  - Later, after you finish your project, you will submit a final report (4+ pages), which should clearly describe the motivation of your project, what you have done, and your findings. A survey needs to be 10+ pages. 
  - A 10-min presentation (in class or video) is also needed.
- Here is the overleaf template for writing proposal and report https://www.overleaf.com/read/bwdqbcxvdmtw


### Timeline
- Week 2-5: Students meet with me to discuss project topic.
- Week 6: Selection of final project topic done. Project proposal due by end of May 13th, 2022 (Sunday). 
- Week 10: Finish up your final project
- Final week: Final project report as well as your recorded presentation are due.
